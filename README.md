# üèÄ Basketball Scoreboard

Hey there!   
This is a simple basketball scoreboard website I built as part of a **Scrimba Frontend Career Path solo project**. The goal of this project was to practice working with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to build something interactive from scratch.

The app lets you track the scores for two teams: **Home** and **Guest**. You can update the scores using buttons, and everything updates instantly on the page without refreshing. I also played around with styling and used a digital-style font to make the scoreboard look cooler.
